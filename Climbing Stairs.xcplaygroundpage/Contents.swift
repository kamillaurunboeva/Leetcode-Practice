/*You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
 
 Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

  

 Example 1:

 Input: n = 2
 Output: 2
 Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
 1. 1 step + 1 step
 2. 2 steps
 Example 2:

 Input: n = 3
 Output: 3
 Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
 2. 1 step + 2 steps
 3. 2 steps + 1 step
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= n <= 45*/
